"LetsGrowMore is a community of the students, for the students and by the students."

LETSGROWMORE is a community of diverse people coming together with similar objectives and ultimate goals. LETS GROW MORE deep downed its roots at the very beginning of this year as a result of an idea that was brought up to be real by the Founder of LETSGROWMORE - AMAN KESARWANI.

LETSGROWMORE is all about creating opportunities for leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering of shared interests. We develop enriching environments and experiences that promote students' knowledge and wellbeing.
